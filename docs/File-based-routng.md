title: File-Based Routing
---

Most of the TanStack Router documentation is written for file-based routing and is intended to help you understand in more detail how to configure file-based routing and the technical details behind how it works. While file-based routing is the preferred and recommended way to configure TanStack Router, you can also use [code-based routing](./code-based-routing.md) if you prefer.

## Directory Routes

Directories can be used to denote route hierarchy, which can be useful for organizing multiple routes into logical groups and also cutting down on the filename length for large groups of deeply nested routes:

| Filename                | Route Path                | Component Output                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Ê¦ `__root.tsx`          |                           | `<Root>`                          |
| Ê¦ `index.tsx`           | `/` (exact)               | `<Root><RootIndex>`               |
| Ê¦ `about.tsx`           | `/about`                  | `<Root><About>`                   |
| Ê¦ `posts.tsx`           | `/posts`                  | `<Root><Posts>`                   |
| ðŸ“‚ `posts`              |                           |                                   |
| â”„ Ê¦ `index.tsx`         | `/posts` (exact)          | `<Root><Posts><PostsIndex>`       |
| â”„ Ê¦ `$postId.tsx`       | `/posts/$postId`          | `<Root><Posts><Post>`             |
| ðŸ“‚ `posts_`             |                           |                                   |
| â”„ ðŸ“‚ `$postId`          |                           |                                   |
| â”„ â”„ Ê¦ `edit.tsx`        | `/posts/$postId/edit`     | `<Root><EditPost>`                |
| Ê¦ `settings.tsx`        | `/settings`               | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| ðŸ“‚ `settings`           |                           | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| â”„ Ê¦ `profile.tsx`       | `/settings/profile`       | `<Root><Settings><Profile>`       |
| â”„ Ê¦ `notifications.tsx` | `/settings/notifications` | `<Root><Settings><Notifications>` |
| Ê¦ `_layout.tsx`         |                           | `<Root><Layout>`                  |
| ðŸ“‚ `_layout`            |                           |                                   |
| â”„ Ê¦ `layout-a.tsx`      | `/layout-a`               | `<Root><Layout><LayoutA>`         |
| â”„ Ê¦ `layout-b.tsx`      | `/layout-b`               | `<Root><Layout><LayoutB>`         |
| ðŸ“‚ `files`              |                           |                                   |
| â”„ Ê¦ `$.tsx`             | `/files/$`                | `<Root><Files>`                   |

## Flat Routes

Flat routing gives you the ability to use `.`s to denote route nesting levels. This can be useful when you have a large number of uniquely deeply nested routes and want to avoid creating directories for each one:

| Filename                       | Route Path                | Component Output                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Ê¦ `__root.tsx`                 |                           | `<Root>`                          |
| Ê¦ `index.tsx`                  | `/` (exact)               | `<Root><RootIndex>`               |
| Ê¦ `about.tsx`                  | `/about`                  | `<Root><About>`                   |
| Ê¦ `posts.tsx`                  | `/posts`                  | `<Root><Posts>`                   |
| Ê¦ `posts.index.tsx`            | `/posts` (exact)          | `<Root><Posts><PostsIndex>`       |
| Ê¦ `posts.$postId.tsx`          | `/posts/$postId`          | `<Root><Posts><Post>`             |
| Ê¦ `posts_.$postId.edit.tsx`    | `/posts/$postId/edit`     | `<Root><EditPost>`                |
| Ê¦ `settings.tsx`               | `/settings`               | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| Ê¦ `settings.profile.tsx`       | `/settings/profile`       | `<Root><Settings><Profile>`       |
| Ê¦ `settings.notifications.tsx` | `/settings/notifications` | `<Root><Settings><Notifications>` |
| Ê¦ `_layout.tsx`                |                           | `<Root><Layout>`                  |
| Ê¦ `_layout.layout-a.tsx`       | `/layout-a`               | `<Root><Layout><LayoutA>`         |
| Ê¦ `_layout.layout-b.tsx`       | `/layout-b`               | `<Root><Layout><LayoutB>`         |
| Ê¦ `files.$.tsx`                | `/files/$`                | `<Root><Files>`                   |

## Mixed Flat and Directory Routes

It's extremely likely that a 100% directory or flat route structure won't be the best fit for your project, which is why TanStack Router allows you to mix both flat and directory routes together to create a route tree that uses the best of both worlds where it makes sense:

| Filename                       | Route Path                | Component Output                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Ê¦ `__root.tsx`                 |                           | `<Root>`                          |
| Ê¦ `index.tsx`                  | `/` (exact)               | `<Root><RootIndex>`               |
| Ê¦ `about.tsx`                  | `/about`                  | `<Root><About>`                   |
| Ê¦ `posts.tsx`                  | `/posts`                  | `<Root><Posts>`                   |
| ðŸ“‚ `posts`                     |                           |                                   |
| â”„ Ê¦ `index.tsx`                | `/posts` (exact)          | `<Root><Posts><PostsIndex>`       |
| â”„ Ê¦ `$postId.tsx`              | `/posts/$postId`          | `<Root><Posts><Post>`             |
| â”„ Ê¦ `$postId.edit.tsx`         | `/posts/$postId/edit`     | `<Root><Posts><Post><EditPost>`   |
| Ê¦ `settings.tsx`               | `/settings`               | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| Ê¦ `settings.profile.tsx`       | `/settings/profile`       | `<Root><Settings><Profile>`       |
| Ê¦ `settings.notifications.tsx` | `/settings/notifications` | `<Root><Settings><Notifications>` |

Both flat and directory routes can be mixed together to create a route tree that uses the best of both worlds where it makes sense.

> [!TIP]
> If you find the need to customize the location of your route files or completely override the discovery of routes, you can use [Virtual File Routes](./virtual-file-routes.md) to programmatically build your route tree while still getting the awesome benefits of file-based routing.

## Dynamic Path Params

Dynamic path params can be used in both flat and directory routes to create routes that can match a dynamic segment of the URL path. Dynamic path params are denoted by the `$` character in the filename:

| Filename              | Route Path       | Component Output      |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| ...                   | ...              | ...                   |
| Ê¦ `posts.$postId.tsx` | `/posts/$postId` | `<Root><Posts><Post>` |

We'll learn more about dynamic path params in the [Path Params](./path-params.md) guide.

## Pathless Routes

Pathless routes wrap child routes with either logic or a component without requiring a URL path. Non-path routes are denoted by the `_` character in the filename:

| Filename       | Route Path | Component Output |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Ê¦ `_app.tsx`   |            |                  |
| Ê¦ `_app.a.tsx` | /a         | `<Root><App><A>` |
| Ê¦ `_app.b.tsx` | /b         | `<Root><App><B>` |

To learn more about pathless routes, see the [Routing Concepts - Pathless Routes](./routing-concepts.md#pathless-routes) guide.

## File Naming Conventions

File-based routing requires that you follow a few simple file naming conventions to ensure that your routes are generated correctly. The concepts these conventions enable are covered in detail in the [Route Trees & Nesting](./route-trees.md) guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Routes starting with `/api` are reserved and cannot not be used for file-based routing. These routes are reserved for future use by the TanStack Start for API routes. If you need to use routes starting with `/api` when using TanStack Router with file-based routing, then you'll need to configure the `apiBase` option to a different value.

> **ðŸ’¡ Remember:** The file-naming conventions for your project could be affected by what [options](#options) are configured in your `tsr.config.json`. By default, the `routeFileIgnorePrefix` option is set to `-`, as such files and directories starting with `-` will not be considered for routing.

- **`__root.tsx`**
  - The root route file must be named `__root.tsx` and must be placed in the root of the configured `routesDirectory`.
- **`.` Separator**
  - Routes can use the `.` character to denote a nested route. For example, `blog.post` will be generated as a child of `blog`.
- **`$` Token**
  - Routes segments with the `$` token are parameterized and will extract the value from the URL pathname as a route `param`.
- **`_` Prefix**
  - Routes segments with the `_` prefix are considered layout-routes and will not be used when matching its child routes against the URL pathname.
- **`_` Suffix**
  - Routes segments with the `_` suffix exclude the route from being nested under any parent routes.
- **`(folder)` folder name pattern**:
  - A folder that matches this pattern is treated as a **route group** which prevents this folder to be included in the route's URL path.
- **`index` Token**
  - Routes segments ending with the `index` token (but before any file types) will be used to match the parent route when the URL pathname matches the parent route exactly.
    This can be configured via the `indexToken` configuration option, see [options](#options).
- **`.route.tsx` File Type**
  - When using directories to organize your routes, the `route` suffix can be used to create a route file at the directory's path. For example, `blog.post.route.tsx` or `blog/post/route.tsx` can be used at the route file for the `/blog/post` route.
    This can be configured via the `routeToken` configuration option, see [options](#options).
- **`.lazy.tsx` File Type**
  - The `lazy` suffix can be used to code-split components for a route. For example, `blog.post.lazy.tsx` will be used as the component for the `blog.post` route.
